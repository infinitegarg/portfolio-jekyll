    <p>Youâ€™ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

    To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

    Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="cell small-9 medium-8">
    <img src="{{ page.image-url }}">
  </div>
</div>
