    <div class="section-heading">TLDR;</div>
    <p>Work at a startup and you’ll get to learn a lot. Yes, it will be fast paced and you might end up giving your weekends but it’ll help you grow.
    </p>
    <p>Read further to know how I worked as a Product Designer, Product Manager, Frontend Developer, Backend Developer and Motion Graphics Designer
    </p>

    <div class="dots"></div>
    <br>

    <p>Its been almost 3 years since I joined my current startup, Innovaccer, as a Product Designer.
      I was expecting to work on UX research, creating prototypes and mockups, interacting with customers and getting feedbacks, planning marketing etc in a fast paced environment.
    </p>
    <p>But has it ever happened to you that things go as planned ?
    </p>
    <p>I’m glad it didn’t and I got to work on a hell lot of things.
      <br>
      Being a Computer Science graduate, I had a background in web development. Also, my curiosity of learning new things had me introduced to a lot more techs. All thanks to the Computer Society, I was a part of, in the college.
    </p>
    <p>Eventually, I worked unofficially at different roles. I’ll try to jot down my learnings while performing those roles.</p>
    <div class="section-heading">Frontend Developer</div>
    <p>Many things are being said for designers who code. I believe it is an added advantage since it lets you do a very different kind of research before designing. Things such as feasibility, tech challenges, scalability, code reusability etc. become a part of design thinking which helps in the development life cycle and making the product a success.
      <br>
      As a designer, I’m always keen on providing pixel perfect UIs as per the design including all the functionalities to provide the user a better experience. I worked on different kinds of projects.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Landing Pages - (you know those pages you land on when you click a link in the mail !). These were majorly design rich static pages with minimal interactions.</li>
      <li>Responsive HTML Email Templates - I learnt to use INKY by Foundation for Emails that helped create templates real quick. These templates were for different purposes like newsletters, customer emails, daily data updates etc.</li>
      <li>Webapps - These were functionality rich applications with integration to backend using RESTful APIs. I learnt a lot while doing these - maintaining UI states, using directives, controllers and other features of Angular Js.
        <br>
        I was part of two projects - A webapp to compare hospitals in US and other to create User Management in an existing product with Access control logic for permissions.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul class="no-style">
      <li>Techs known before this: Foundation 6, jQuery, SaaS, Git, RESTful APIs</li>
      <li>Techs which I learnt: <strong>Angular JS, Google App Engine, Gulp, Bower, npm, browserSync, Foundation for Emails, SVG animation</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <br>


    <div class="section-heading">Backend Developer</div>
    <p>Back in the college, I started backend with php but I never liked it. That was the end of backend development for me, I thought. But things had to go other ways, remember “things never go as planned.”
    </p>
    <p>I was given a task to create a small webapp to monitor the productive hours of employees at our startup. This involved integrating google authentication and creating APIs for the frontend to save the data in MongoDB.
    </p>
    <p>Fun Fact: Remember the infamous <strong>MongoDB ransomware attack</strong> ? Incidentally, it happened to be after a week of my learning mongoDB and I insisted on our engineers to have an auth on the api endpoints as they were public prior to it. Saved the day. Pat on the back.
    </p>

    <ul class="no-style">
      <li>Techs known before this: php</li>
      <li>Techs which I learnt: <strong>python basics, mongoDB</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <br>


    <div class="section-heading">Motion Graphic Designer</div>
    <p>Static Illustrations never gave me a feeling of satisfaction. They somehow lack in providing the feel and information. Also, an application without UI micro-interactions is like a song without any music. I started my journey with VFX during college. Yes i was obsessed with Hollywood !
      <br>
      Here I created small UI interactions for the developers and motion graphics for the website.
    </p>

    <ul class="no-style">
      <li>Techs known before this: After Effects, CSS Animation</li>
      <li>Techs which I learnt: <strong>Airbnb’s Lottie, SVG Animation, Invision Studio</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <br>


    <div class="section-heading">Product Manager</div>
    <p>Unlike before, by now our startup had different full fledged teams including designer, QA, engineers, PMs etc working on different products.
      <br>
      I happened to be working on a cross-team project as a designer. There was no PM assigned for this particular project as engineers from different teams were working on the same piece leading to a lot of inconsistencies in design and functionality.
    </p>

    <p>It was an opportunity area for me (and I always wanted to try the Product Manager role).
      <br>
      I took up the job and defined the project thoroughly backed by business research, on Confluence. Later I planned sprints with developers in an agile framework, conducted Scrum meetings to have regular follow-ups and gathered continuous feedback from the stakeholders.
      <br>
      Shipping a project and giving release notes was another feeling altogether.
    </p>

    <ul class="no-style">
      <li>Major Learnings: better understanding of software development lifecycles, maintaining active sprints and backlogs to ship a full fledged product, <strong>Confluence</strong> and <strong>Jira</strong>.</li>
    </ul>

    <br>

    <div class="section-heading">Product Designer</div>
    <p class="mb-2">Well, I was hired as one so obviously I was responsible for
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>gathering requirements from the PMs, stakeholders, customers etc.</li>
      <li>Brainstorming and creating sketches</li>
      <li>Creating user personas, user journeys with behavioural traits, empathy maps, mood boards, information system</li>
      <li>Maintaining design library</li>
      <li>Creating mockups and prototyping</li>
      <li>Gathering feedback</li>
      <li>Planning marketing and business with the stakeholders</li>
    </ul>

    <ul class="no-style">
      <li>Techs known before this: Photoshop, Illustrator, Sketch</li>
      <li>Techs which I learnt: <strong>Invision, Zeplin, Abstract, Invision Studio, Framer, draw.io</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>All of this helped me improve my skills and made me have a better understanding of the product development journey at each step. This allows me to communicate better with my teammates, have empathy towards them and create awesome user experiences.
