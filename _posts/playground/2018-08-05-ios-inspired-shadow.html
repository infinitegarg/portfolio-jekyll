      iOS 11 introduced this pretty shadow effect using blur. I wanted to recreate this for web using CSS.
    </p>
    <p>
      This particular effect has two layers of images, the background one having blur effect.<br>
      However, on researching I found this property <span class="code">backdrop-filter</span> but unfortunately it is not supported by most web browsers. Only Edge and Safari supports it as of now. <a href="https://caniuse.com/#search=backdrop-filter">caniuse</a>
      </p>

      <p>
        You can find the original CSS effect on codepen <a href="https://codepen.io/infinitegarg/pen/dprbmL">here</a>
